<H2>Cupcake155</H2>
Cupcake155 is a modernized Reprap style printer, made from the body of an original MakerBot Cupcake (SN: 155, in my case).

This repo contains the files I have changed to suit the needs of my printer, Cupcake155. You can find the marlin sources here: https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin

I've also included some STLs for addons, some designed by me, some taken from elsewhere.
